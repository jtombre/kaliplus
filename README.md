# kali
These files were created to help update the kali VM distro. These updates allow for a simple way to update the distro, add functionality similar to "The Hacker Playbook" and allow for installation of tools, documents and examples for an isolated environment. If you don't have google, this makes it a little bit easier. 

## Kali Firstrun Setup 
 ./kali/scripts/kali-firstrun-setup.bash will perform generally first run options that will assist with updating kali, remote ssh for automated updates and ova creation. 

## Kali Update
 ./kali/scripts/kali-update.bash will update kali with the latest and greatest kali patches. This should be run often and before exporting the vm.
